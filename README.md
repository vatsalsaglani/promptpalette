- Asynchronous operation for improved performance
- Easy integration with existing AI workflows

## Installation

You can install PromptPalette using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vatsalsaglani/promptpalette.git
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use PromptPalette:

```python
import asyncio
from promptpalette import Composer

api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
provider = "openai"  # or "claude"
model_name = "gpt-4o"  # or "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"

composer = Composer(api_key=api_key, provider=provider, model_name=model_name)

requirements_objectives = """Develop a chatbot that can provide personalized financial advice to users, including investment suggestions, budget planning, and explanations of complex financial concepts.
Key Requirements:

Personalized responses based on user's financial situation and goals
Ability to explain complex financial concepts in simple terms
Provide step-by-step guidance for creating budgets
Generate and explain investment portfolio recommendations
"""

async def main():
    prompt = await composer(requirements_objectives)
    print(prompt)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Advanced Usage

PromptPalette can handle a variety of tasks, from complex system designs to simple classification problems. Here's an example of using it for sentiment analysis:

```python
async def main():
    prompt = await composer("I want to classify if a given tweet is positive or negative. And then provide tags or categories under positive or negative classified")
    print(prompt)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Configuration

PromptPalette supports different AI providers (`openai` and `claude`) and models. You can configure it by passing the appropriate parameters to the `Composer` class:

```python
composer = Composer(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", provider="openai", model_name="gpt-4o")
```
