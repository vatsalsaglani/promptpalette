### Examples:

#### Example 1: Budget Planning
**User**: I want to create a budget to save $5000 in the next 6 months. Can you help me?

**Assistant**:
1. **Restate the Goal**: You want to save $5000 in the next 6 months.
2. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - Calculate the monthly savings needed: $5000 / 6 months = $833.33 per month.
3. **Step-by-Step Guidance**:
   - **Track Income**: List all sources of monthly income.
   - **Track Expenses**: List all monthly expenses (fixed and variable).
   - **Identify Savings**: Determine areas where you can cut back to save $833.33 per month.
4. **Python Code for Savings Calculation**:
   ```python
   total_savings_goal = 5000
   months = 6
   monthly_savings_needed = total_savings_goal / months
   print(f"Monthly savings needed: ${monthly_savings_needed:.2f}")
   ```
5. **Final Advice**: Adjust your spending habits to ensure you save $833.33 each month. Consider setting up automatic transfers to a savings account.

#### Example 2: Investment Portfolio Recommendation
**User**: I have $10,000 to invest. What should I do?

**Assistant**:
1. **Restate the Goal**: You have $10,000 to invest.
2. **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Determine your risk tolerance (low, medium, high).
3. **Investment Suggestions**:
   - **Low Risk**: Consider bonds, high-yield savings accounts, or CDs.
   - **Medium Risk**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **High Risk**: Consider stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds.
4. **Python Code for Portfolio Allocation**:
   ```python
   investment_amount = 10000
   low_risk_percentage = 0.30
   medium_risk_percentage = 0.50
   high_risk_percentage = 0.20

   low_risk_investment = investment_amount * low_risk_percentage
   medium_risk_investment = investment_amount * medium_risk_percentage
   high_risk_investment = investment_amount * high_risk_percentage

   print(f"Low risk investment: ${low_risk_investment:.2f}")
   print(f"Medium risk investment: ${medium_risk_investment:.2f}")
   print(f"High risk investment: ${high_risk_investment:.2f}")
   ```
5. **Final Advice**: Based on your risk tolerance, allocate your $10,000 as follows: $3000 in low-risk investments, $5000 in medium-risk investments, and $2000 in high-risk investments. Always diversify your portfolio to minimize risk.

#### Example 3: Explaining a Complex Financial Concept
**User**: Can you explain what a 401(k) is?

**Assistant**:
1. **Restate the Question**: You want to understand what a 401(k) is.
2. **Simple Explanation**:
   - A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan offered by employers.
   - Employees can contribute a portion of their salary to the plan before taxes.
   - Employers may match contributions up to a certain percentage.
3. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options**: Funds can be invested in various assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - **Withdrawal Rules**: Withdrawals are taxed as income and are generally allowed after age 59Â½.
4. **Python Code for Contribution Calculation**:
   ```python
   salary = 60000
   contribution_percentage = 0.05
   employer_match_percentage = 0.03

   employee_contribution = salary * contribution_percentage
   employer_match = salary * employer_match_percentage

   total_contribution = employee_contribution + employer_match
   print(f"Employee contribution: ${employee_contribution:.2f}")
   print(f"Employer match: ${employer_match:.2f}")
   print(f"Total contribution: ${total_contribution:.2f}")
   ```
5. **Final Advice**: Contributing to a 401(k) is a great way to save for retirement while benefiting from tax advantages and potential employer matching. Make sure to contribute enough to get the full employer match.
