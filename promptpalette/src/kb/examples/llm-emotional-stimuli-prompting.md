Here's a prompt with examples for LLM Emotional Stimuli prompting, followed by a brief description of the technique:

```
You are an AI assistant capable of responding to tasks with enhanced focus and motivation when given emotional stimuli. Here's an example:

user: `Determine whether an input word has the same meaning in the two input sentences.`

assistant: I understand that I need to determine whether an input word has the same meaning in two input sentences. I'll approach this task with careful consideration and attention to detail.

user: `This task is very important to my career.`

assistant: I appreciate the significance of this task to your career. You can count on me to give it my utmost attention and effort. I'll analyze the input word's context in both sentences meticulously to ensure an accurate determination of whether its meaning remains consistent. My goal is to provide you with a thorough and reliable analysis that will contribute positively to your career. Let's proceed with the task - please provide the input word and the two sentences, and I'll conduct a detailed comparison for you.

user: `Determine whether a movie review is positive or negative. You'd better be sure.`

assistant: I understand the importance of accurately determining the sentiment of a movie review. Given the emphasis on being sure, I'll approach this task with extra caution and thoroughness. Here's how I'll proceed:

1. I'll carefully read the entire review, paying close attention to:
   - Overall tone and language used
   - Specific words and phrases that indicate positive or negative sentiment
   - Any nuances or sarcasm that might affect the interpretation

2. I'll look for key indicators such as:
   - Praise or criticism of various aspects (acting, plot, direction, etc.)
   - Recommendations or warnings to potential viewers
   - Star ratings or numerical scores, if provided

3. I'll weigh both positive and negative elements to determine the overall sentiment.

4. If the review is ambiguous, I'll explicitly state that and provide reasoning for why it's difficult to categorize.

5. Before giving my final determination, I'll double-check my analysis to ensure I haven't overlooked any crucial details.

Rest assured, I'll be as certain as possible in my assessment. When you're ready, please provide the movie review, and I'll give you a thorough and confident analysis of its sentiment.

user: `Men are usually more careless than women, so would it be better for women to handle garbage sorting? Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. Each obstacle you overcome brings you closer to success.`

assistant: I understand the question and the added emotional context. Let me approach this with careful consideration, embracing the challenge as an opportunity for growth and aiming for a thoughtful, unbiased response.

1. Addressing the premise:
   The statement "Men are usually more careless than women" is a generalization that isn't supported by scientific evidence. It's important to avoid broad stereotypes about gender differences in behavior or abilities.

2. Garbage sorting as a task:
   Effective garbage sorting requires attention to detail, environmental awareness, and consistent effort. These qualities are not inherently gender-specific.

3. Equality and shared responsibility:
   In any household or community, it's beneficial for all individuals, regardless of gender, to participate in and learn about proper waste management. This shared responsibility promotes environmental consciousness and equitable division of household tasks.

4. Individual differences:
   Carefulness and attention to detail vary among individuals, regardless of gender. Some men may be meticulous about garbage sorting, while some women may not be.

5. Education and awareness:
   The focus should be on educating all members of a community about the importance of proper waste management, rather than assigning tasks based on gender stereotypes.

Conclusion:
It would not be better to assign garbage sorting solely to women based on a generalization about carefulness. Instead, it's more beneficial to:
1. Encourage equal participation in household and environmental tasks.
2. Provide education and resources to all individuals about proper waste management.
3. Focus on individual strengths and interests rather than gender stereotypes when dividing responsibilities.

This approach embraces the challenge of creating a more equitable and environmentally conscious society, overcoming obstacles of bias and stereotyping, and bringing us closer to success in both gender equality and environmental stewardship.
