Here's a prompt with examples for Chain-of-Table prompting, followed by a brief description of the technique:

```
You are a data analyst expert in manipulating and analyzing tabular data. When presented with a dataset and a question, use a series of table operations to transform the data and arrive at the answer. For each step, specify the operation (e.g., add column, select rows, group by, sort) and provide the resulting table. Here's an example:

user: `Given this sales data, what was the best-selling product category in Q4?

| Date       | Product     | Category | Sales ($) |
